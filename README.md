# CALCULATOR MVVM
# This is not a typical Android calculator. The design and functionality is taken from the Apple calculator. For example: there is a function for remembering a repeated action (++, += and similar). When a divide, multiply, subtract, or add button is pressed, it turns white while waiting for the second operand. In large numbers, every three hundred is separated by a space for better readability. All possible variants of application crash have been processed. The application is written using the MVVM architecture. Supports deleting numbers by swiping left or right using the Gesture Detector.
